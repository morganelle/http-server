# HTTP-SERVER

This assignment is composed of implementing and testing the server/client module for output integrity.

## Getting Started

You can test the series by running pytest after installer the requirements.

### Test data

To test the server, we had to create a matrix of requests for use in client() function. Please see test_servers.py

The predicted output will be a HTTP 200 OK with the URI, or a 405, 505, or 400 message.

## Deployment

For deployment and install, execute setup.py and run tox.ini, or pytest.
